# Pokemon-JSON

##Development
1. Index page
2. JS script
3. scss/css
3. pokemon HTMLs

##Details
-I created a function that would go through each parsed any pokemon JSON object, create elements to contain the information, and put the elements in the document. I then applied this function to each of the different pokemon.
-CSS was used to style different parts of the elements created, which were given ids and classes in the script
